- Axum uses the same format as expressJS so to define a dynamic route, we use colon such as :

- Integrating Database steps 
+ Presenting extrators (Form) which helps to deserialize the incoming request
+ Adding the subscriber route
+ Adding the subscriber handler which also takes the form as an input
+ Added a script to run postgr as a docker container and perform migration
+ Divide the code in lib into routes(healthy_check, subscriber, and mod)
+ Added a configuration.rs file to customize the port and database settings
+ Integrating database - sqlx
+
